Obtaining a timely and accurate picture of poverty is crucial to developing effective policies and ensuring that resources are being properly allocated. Conventional means of collecting data, such household
surveys and censuses,tend to encounter problems like high expenses, logistical challen-ges,and infrequent revisions, particularly in hard-to-reach or less developed regions. To meet these
challenges, recent research has explored the use of satellite imagery and machine learning as a newapproach to measure and forecast poverty levels throughout multiple regions. At the core of such an
approach is utilization of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs),that scan highresolution satellite images. These models are trained to identify features such as infras-
tructure density, road networks, vegetation cover, and land use patterns—all factors that can predicteconomic well being. Utilizing labeled datasets that correlate satellite images with recognized socio-economic indicators, such models can predict economic conditions in regions that have no current
survey data. For instance, studies have found that CNNs are able to explain up to 75% of variation in local economic outcomes based data. Even more so, using satellite transfer learning methods enhan-
ces the model’s versatility, enabling pre-trained models to be transferred to new geographic locationswith minimal retraining requirements. The approach offers an efficient, costsaving, and timely so-
lution for poverty mapping, enabling policymakers, NGOs, and international development agenciesto target their initiatives more effectively. It also allows for ongoing monitoring of poverty trends,
enabling stakeholders to assess the impact of development programs over time. By leveraging satellite data, we can achieve comprehensive coverage, even in the hardest-to-reach places, bridging the gap
between data shortages and informed decision-making. Ultimately, this blend of artificial intelligence and satellite technology is paving the way for smarter, more effective poverty alleviation strategies.
