# Pothole_detection_using_DeepingLearning


Timely and accurate poverty data is essential for effective policies and resource allocation.
Traditional methods (surveys, censuses) are costly, infrequent, and hard to conduct in remote areas.
Satellite imagery and machine learning offer a new, efficient approach to measure and forecast poverty.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) analyze high-resolution satellite images to detect features like infrastructure, roads, vegetation, and land use.
CNNs trained on labeled data can predict economic conditions even in areas without surveys, explaining up to 75% of local economic variation.
Transfer learning makes models adaptable to new regions with minimal retraining.This method is cost-effective, timely, and enables continuous 
monitoring of poverty trends. It helps policymakers and organizations better target and evaluate development programs.
Combining AI and satellite data bridges data gaps and supports smarter poverty alleviation strategies.
